The first half of the course (sessions 1-6) will focus specifically on the matrix product states (MPS) tensor network formalism, while the second half (sessions 7-10) will survey topics related to tensor network methods in general. The first session will introduce the participants to the basics of tensor networks, while also highlighting examples of applications for tensor networks. An overview of the topics of this course will also be given in this session. In the remaining nine sessions, the course participants will take turns presenting topics based on reading material, which will be assigned every week. The presenters will also facilitate group discussions of their topics.\nThe 10 course sessions will be held on Wednesday from 4.00pm to 5.15pm Mountain Daylight Time and will follow the usual ‘hybrid’ format with both in-person attendance at PAIS room 2540 and virtual attendance using Zoom."
